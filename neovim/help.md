## Neovim 

In Neovim (or nvim)

1. `Esc + %`: To create a new file
2. `Esc + d`: To create a directory
3. `Esc + :Ex`: To go to previous lane (or path)

After making changes to a `.lua` file call `Esc + :so + Enter` to scream saying it's modified so, load it again. then, `Esc + :PackerSync + Enter` to sync in the changes.
