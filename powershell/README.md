## Config for Powershell 

You can actually write custom config to your `powershell` profiles. 

- Firstly, open a new powershell profile and type in `$PROFILE` and hit enter.
- After performing the above action you would have seen a path such as `<rest-of-the-path>\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
- This directory and file might be there or might not be. Check if it exists; if not; create the `.ps1` file in the above path. And add necessary config's
- I'll soon attach my config file here. Check it out if you are curious (coming soon)

```ps1
Write-Host "Hello, Vidhan."
```
